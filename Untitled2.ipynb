    "\n",
    "Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a widely used method to select the optimal value of lambda in Lasso Regression. In cross-validation, the dataset is divided into k folds, and the model is trained on k-1 folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, each time with a different fold held out for testing. The average validation error across all folds is used to select the optimal value of lambda that minimizes the error.\n",

    "Information criterion: Another approach to select the optimal value of lambda is to use information criteria such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). These criteria balance the trade-off between the goodness of fit of the model and the complexity of the model, and select the optimal value of lambda that minimizes the criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search: Grid search involves testing a range of values of lambda over a grid of possible values and selecting the one that performs best on the validation set. This method can be computationally expensive, but it can be useful for exploring a wide range of lambda values and identifying the best value.\n",

    "Analytical solutions: For some special cases of Lasso Regression, such as when the input features are orthogonal or when the regularization penalty is a scaled version of the L1 norm, there exist analytical solutions for the optimal value of lambda.\n",
